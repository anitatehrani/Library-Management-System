# Library-Management-System
Project Overview: This project involves implementing a library management system similar to existing systems used in bookstores or libraries. The system will organize information about books, authors, storage locations, and more in a structured manner. Through a console interface, users will be able to manage various operations related to the library system.

General Structure: The system will consist of components such as books, libraries, shelves, and their respective contents. Each library will have multiple shelves, where books are stored. Libraries are identified by name and address. Shelves serve as storage locations for books, and when a new book is added to a library, it should be placed in the first available empty shelf based on priority. The priority is determined by factors such as book type, shelf capacity, and current occupancy. Shelf capacity is predefined, and attempting to add a book to a full shelf will result in an error message. Each shelf is dedicated to books of a specific genre, in addition to its capacity and current contents.

Books contain various information including title, author, ISBN, genre, price, and publisher.
